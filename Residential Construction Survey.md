## Goal and Timing

The Residential Construction Survey is run yearly, typically during November or December, to collect data on housing unit change at the municipal-level for the next estimates year. We need to the housing unit data to use the housing unit method for estimating population at these levels.  Data on building permits, certificates of occupancy, demolition permits (or housing loss), and mobile home change are collected according to the definitions below.

While we've typically launched the survey at the beginning of December, due to the Census moving their date for housing unit review in their process forward, this process should by in the field by the week after the Annual Meeting, the first Friday in November.  

## Data Collected

The RCS collects data on building permits, certificates of occupancy, demolition permits (housing loss), and mobile home change.  We do so following specific definitions and timing to adhere to the estimates methodology and to the Census review requirements.  While the timing below represent the specific definitions, we need a consistent time-series from 2011 forward for inclusion in the estimates.

### Building Permits

The data needed to track building permits are the number of permitted residential **units** by month.  These are not to include additions, roofs, etc. that do not result in the creation of a new living unit.  It's important that this definition is adhered to, as we often find under counting of multi-family units and overcounting of new units due to these issues.  

Building permits are issued at the beginning of the construction process, therefore, we assume a 6 month lag between issuance and completion.  This means the for the July 1, 2017 estimates, we use calendar year 2016 building permits.  We will accept data more recent than that, but it won't be included in the estimates process.

### Certificates of Occupancy

The data for certificates of occupancy is similar to building permits, but represents the number of completed **units** by month. These are only to include residential units, not commercial.  We get far fewer submissions of these, but the submissions we do get are typically correct.

Certificates of occupancy are issued once the unit is considered habitable by the permitting entity. As such, we assume that they are immediately available and in the housing stock with no lag.  So for a July 1, 2017 estimate, we require certificates of occupancy from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 by month.  

### Demolition Permits 

The data for demolition permits are designed to represent a way to track housing unit loss.  This could be due to actual demolition, natural disaster, etc.  We asked for the number of demolished **units** by month and while this isn't a hard and fast rule we require a demolition permit to be referenced.  Demolition permits are tricky.  First, not everywhere issues them.  Second, some places offer building and demolition permits in one for scrape and rebuild projects, meaning we need to be careful about how we collect them to avoid double counting.

As for timing, we use the same assumption as certificates of occupancy, that as soon as a demolition permit is issued, the housing unit is lost to the housing stock.  For a July 1, 2017 estimate, we require demolition permits from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 by month.

## Data Presented

Communities are also able to view the prior vintage of estimates, including data from the Census and prior construction data during the RCS.  This helps in providing corrections of previous submissions and provides an opportunity for feedback.
