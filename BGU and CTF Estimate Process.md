# BGU and CTF Estimate Process

## Process Notes

The BGU process is the process we use to build special district estimates.  BGU stands for Basic Geographic Unit.  That means that each BGU is a geographic area uniquely identified by the County, Place, and Special Districts that are overlapping the area.  We've recently moved this level of the process to the housing unit method as well.  We then use these to build the Special District estimates used by the CTF program.
