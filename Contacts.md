# Contacts

1. Contact Lists
  1. Contact lists for CTF and Census Purposes live in the MailChimp Account we've maintained.
    1. Access is email based, so either Barb or Elizabeth can provide access via an invitation to the proper account provided you're reading this and Rob hasn't done so.
    2. The CTF lists are pre-fixed with CTF.
    3. Lists are updated as we review MailChimp for emails that are bad, or as we are notified of a contact update.
  2. City and County
    3. CTF/RCS - I use the LGISSurveyContactInfo_CaC as a start when a places contact isn't working.  I then escalate to higher levels of the government using the LGIS system to check (for a tutorial on that, check with our Program Assistant).
  3. Districts
    1. Districts typically don't need their own set of different contacts, so I've been using this query: LGISSurveyContactInfoSD every year.  It pulls the CTF district contact they certify through their yearly CTF certification.  This has been the best list to use.
    2. I literally delete the entire list and re-upload this one (or have it check the old one) for each survey.
