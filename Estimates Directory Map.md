# Estimates Directory Map


- Adjustments
  - This is where the annexations and migration adjustment tables live along with supporting documents.
- Admin
  - This file has documentation and instructions, website updates (the files we use for CTF and RCS challenge sites and processes), and other administrative data for the position.
- Age Estimates
  - These are my abandoned attempts at Age Estimates, Cindy's method worked much better, so I stopped.  I left them here in case they might be useful.
- Archive
  - This folder has all of the previous databases archived for as long as we've used Access to make the estimates. 
- CensusEstimatesData
  - This folder has a lot of data we use in it, including the Census data masters, review files from FSCPE and our responses.  It's all related to Population, not housing.
- ConstructionData
  - This folder contains all the construction data masters as well as the folders we use to hold all of the data we gather from the RCS.
- CTFDocuments
  - This folder has data on participating entities, I usually just use the database tables I mention in the Database Manual.
- Elizabeth
  - This folder is exclusively for Elizabeth to put stuff she's working on in.  It's mostly documents she's playing around with.
- GIS Data
  - This folder contains a few different GIS files, but in general we should be using files from the ESRI Geodatabases,  provided by Todd or directly from the database.
- GroupQuartersData

  - This directory contains all of the GQ data in an Access Database, plus GQ survey responses from the RCS ask and the College Survey we do each year.
- HistoricalDatabases

  - These are old, historical data, they are of varying degrees of accuracy and almost none of them match our online data.  This is a huge project we need to do, figure out what's right.
- HistoricalEstimates & VintagingProject

  - This is my first attempt to look at the historical issues, it's not done or even right, but could be a useful start.
- IndicatorData

  - This file contains records on IRS migration, school enrollment, and other indicator data we used to us in Ratio-regression estimates.  I had been trying to keep the IRS file up to date, but the timeseries breaking changes might be an issue.
- Municipal Estimate Validation

  - This was a folder that I started trying to figure out which municipal estimate was the right one.  We have a lot of different values for most years.
- Other

  - This folder is what it looks like, it has some good information from Eddie and some things I've collected over the years.
- QCEWData

  - This is where we store the QCEW data that I get from the Economist for the counties each year.
- Rob

  - This is where I put stuff that was really experimental, use anything that looks valuable,
- Tables

  - This is where we keep all of the final tables for the annual meeting.  We view these as the final estimates for the year.
- VitalRecordsData

  - This is where we keep all of the birth and death data.  The DPHE folder 'Detailed Tables' has all of the masters and the year named files have the actual files we get from Kirk Bol at CDPHE.
  - We also put the FSCPE births and deaths reviews.
- Main Folder

  - There are a lot of tables, but the most important thing is keeping the main Estimates2010-20 Access database in here.  I wouldn't work on it in this directory though, take it local.
